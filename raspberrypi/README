The directory fb-patchset contains a patchset for the Raspberry Pi 1/2
Linux kernel that extends the console fb interface to use triple-buffering,
also extending the DMA-accelerated CopyArea system call. The default text
scrolling method is also changed from DMA to optimized screen redraw for
the Raspberry Pi 2.

Directory extend-fb contains obsolete patches for the fb layer of the
Raspberry Pi kernel, which have superseeded by the patchset mentioned
above.
